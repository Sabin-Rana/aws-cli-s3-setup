## üì¶ S3 Bucket Operations

### 4. Create Bucket
```bash
aws s3 mb s3://epicreads-aws-cli-bucket
```

### 5. Upload File
```bash
aws s3 cp "C:\Users\Acer\Pictures\Wallpaper" s3://epicreads-aws-cli-bucket/wallpapers/ --recursive
```
![File Uploaded](https://github.com/Sabin-Rana/aws-cli-s3-setup/blob/main/Screenshots/file-upload.PNG)

### 6. List Files
To confirm that the files have been successfully uploaded, you can view them in the AWS Management Console. Below is a screenshot showing the uploaded files in the S3 bucket.

### 7. Clean Up
1. To delete the S3 bucket and its contents, follow these steps:
First, remove all objects in the bucket with the following command:
```bash
aws s3 rm s3://epicreads-aws-cli-bucket --recursive
```
2. Remove the bucket itself using the following command:
```bash
aws s3 rm s3://epicreads-aws-cli-bucket --recursive=
```
3. Verify the bucket deletion by listing all your buckets. If the bucket is successfully deleted, you will see no result:
```bash
aws s3 ls

```
The following screenshot shows the successful deletion of the epicreads-aws-cli-bucket in the AWS Console:
